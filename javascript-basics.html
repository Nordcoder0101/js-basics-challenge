        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables must be identified unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers.  <span class="make-purple">var x;</span></li><br>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Variable Assignemnt</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured into i, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="make-purple">var x = 10;</span></li><br>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span class="make-purple">true</span> or <span class="make-purple">false;</span> null - <span class="make-purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="make-purple">42</span> or <span class="make-purple">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="make-purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array - <span class="make-purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="make-purple">{first_name: 'Jane', lanst_name: 'Doe'}</span></li><br>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: <span class="make-purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="make-purple">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="make-purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li><br>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Loops</span> Ther are many different kinds of loops in every programming kanguage, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action for some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!</li><br>
          <li><span class="cyan-color">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done!  We finished our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
